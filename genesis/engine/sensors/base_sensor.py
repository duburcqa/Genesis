    A resource shared by several sensor arrays, such as the raycast bounding volume hierarchies (BVHs) that a raycaster
    and a tactile array both cast against.

    An array fetches the context it reads with `SensorManager.get_context` in its `build`, and every array asking for
    the same class gets the one instance SensorManager owns. An array aggregates the state of every sensor of one type, and one kernel runs
    over them. A context is a single resource that several types read. The results of an array are identical whether or
    not the resource is shared, and SensorManager keeps them consistent.

    SensorManager constructs the context with the sim when the first array declaring it is constructed. The context
    stays an empty shell until a consumer activates it:

    - ``activate``: a consuming array calls it from its own ``build``, when the scene geometry is available. The first
      call constructs the resource, and later calls have no effect.
    - ``update``: the manager calls it once per step before the arrays step. An inactive context skips it.
    - ``reset`` and ``destroy``: the manager calls them on ``scene.reset()`` and at teardown.

    Reading the resource of an inactive context raises. Subclasses implement every lifecycle method and guard
    ``update``, ``reset`` and ``destroy`` on ``is_active``.

    ``_update_raw_data`` and ``_apply_physics_imperfections`` are packaged inside ``_update_current_timestep_data``;
    override the latter to fuse them in a single kernel pass.

    Both branches keep their own intermediate-space timeline ring (``_ground_truth_timeline`` /
    ``_measured_timeline``). The timeline rings store post-transform, PRE-hardware-imperfections data, so
    ``_apply_transform`` recurrence reads clean previous slots and stateful filters (e.g. thermal dissipation) are not
    contaminated by hardware noise. Hardware imperfections mutate a per-step working buffer (the intermediate cache),
    never a timeline ring. The post-``_post_process`` snapshot of that working buffer is then frozen into slot 0 of the
    return-space ring, and delay sampling reads stale slots of the return-space ring to produce the user-visible value,
    so each delayed read returns the post-everything signal observed at the step of capture.

    Concrete arrays override the hooks (``_update_raw_data``, ``_update_current_timestep_data``,
    ``_apply_physics_imperfections``, ``_apply_transform``, ``_apply_hardware_imperfections``, ``_post_process``)

        ``data`` is slot 0 of the timeline ring of the branch, to mutate in place. ``timeline`` is that ring: the ground
